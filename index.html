							<p><strong>QUICK NOTE: This is a stand-alone individual project proposal for GSoC 2019. It complements, but does not depend upon, another individual proposal submitted by Alexandra Cheng, with whom the idea for P5 Math in Motion was conceived.</strong></p>
							<p><strong>In a nutshell</strong> we believe code can augment mathematics and make it more accessible.</p>

							<h2>KATEX TO P5 LIBRARY</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>As a stand-alone library</strong> Katex to P5, or K2P5 for short, would enable the use of interactive math symbols inside p5.js with the help of <a href="https://katex.org/">Katex</a>, an open-source JavaScript library that renders beautiful math notation on the web.</p>

							<p>It would contain functions that make it easier for people to use math expressions inside their p5.js projects, and to export their work into other formats.</p>
							<span class="image main">
								<img src="images/gallery/fulls/01.png" alt="" />
							</span>

							<p>K2P5 would also contain functions which would allow users to select and customize entire expressions or individual symbols.</p>
							<span class="image main">
								<img src="images/gallery/fulls/02.png" alt="" />
							</span>

							<p>The above functionality would also enable the use of syntax highlighting with mathematical expressions in a style similar to the one used for code.</p>
							<span class="image main">
								<img src="images/gallery/fulls/03.png" alt="" />
							</span>

							<p><strong>As part of P5 Math in Motion</strong> K2P5 would allow users to animate sequences of transitions between math expressions or symbols, making it easy to build animated solutions and interactive tutorials inside p5.js</p>

						<h2>COMMUNITY IMPACT</h2>
					</header>
					<div class="content">
						<p><strong>Educators</strong> could have an opportunity to integrate perfectly typed math notation inside their projects, and an opportunity to experiment with motion and interactivity inside their STEM curriculum. They could also reach a wider audience, since p5.js projects can be easily edited and shared amongst the community. Though perhaps the most interesting outcome would be to see what happens when we free educators from the confines of static text over a blackboard.</p>

						<p><strong>Learners</strong> would have an opportunity to experience math in a dynamic medium, while having the opportunity to play around with mathematics beyond pencil and paper.</p>

						<p><strong>Designers and artists</strong> would find it easier to add beautiful mathematical notation into their projects, and to export their expressions into different formats. They would also have access to beautiful symbols which are generally obscured in common text editors.</p>

							<h2>ABOUT OSKAR</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Math should jump into a fully digital medium, and p5.js is a great option for starting that transition.</p>
							<p><strong>Oskar Garcia</strong> is majoring in Computer Science and Data Science at Columbia university.</p>
							<p><strong>This project proposal</strong> was inspired by a shared love for mathematics, and because Alex and I dream of a day when we can easily play around with math symbols on digital screens. As an applicant I was looking for an opportunity to dive deep into JavaScript while contributing something meaningful to the OpenSource community.</p>
							<p> Also, math + code = awesome.</p>

						<h2>TIMELINE</h2>
					</header>
					<div class="content">
						<p><strong>Pre-GSoC | APR 9 â€“ MAY 6 |</strong> Touch base with my GSoC mentor, as well as Emily Eisenberg and Sophie Alpert, the creators of Katex. I also want to get better acquainted with JS, P5, and Katex as much as possible during this warm-up time</p>

						<p><strong>Community Bonding | MAY 9 - MAY 27 |</strong> Run design sprints based on our mentor's feedback, in order to produce prototypes that would eventually turn into library components. I also want to interview members of the community to pinpoint their needs and gather their feedback, followed by a round of user testing with our prototypes. This would conclude with a final list of components for production.</p>

						<p><strong>Coding | MAY 27 - AUG 19 |</strong> Work on production while getting some early feedback from users, while adjusting the code as we move along the project's goals.</p>

						<p><strong>Submission and Final Evaluation | AUG 19 - AUG 26 |</strong> Submit our code to the repository, and finish off with the final evaluation.</p>
						<p>Go out and celebrate. Pizza is mandatory.</p>
